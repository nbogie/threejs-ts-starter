Example App using Three.js and Typescript bundled with parcel ðŸš€ðŸ”¥.

Modified from Alberto AdriÃ¡n Pucheta's repo: https://github.com/adrianrey05/parcel-typescript-threejs

And Academy's node.js typescript starter project.

# Road geometry debugging ideas

- Use the normal material (perhaps single-sided if it makes a difference)
- try with just 2 control points
- stretch the curve over, say, 100 world units and visualise the specific positions data we're working with for say 10 segments.
- try with wireframes to count triangles, so we can see triangles vs segments
- try with custom shader with custom info in uv for debugging (e.g. put t in uv.y, or t > 0.5 : 1 : 0)
  - e.g. have a shader represent 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.9 as one of ten colours
- remove normals and UVs so that the BufferGeometry is as simple as possible

# TODO list:

### tech debt TODOs

- Look for ways to reuse road geometry (and curve) rather than creating new each time
- Clean up prev geom in the vertex-normals helper when it needs to make new geom.
- Use slight smoothstep in shader for AA

## fun TODOs

- Allow user to upload a gltf as a vehicle model and have it "race"
- Add a blender roller-coaster carriage model - have it fade in certain hands-up animations when the passengers are overlooking a drop.
- Put a ragdoll passenger in the car.
- On switching to wireframe mode, use a standard material or custom shader that makes wireframe clear.
- Export tracks to text (e.g. to data URLs)
- Add some slight sinusoidal vehicle movement as it follows the curve.
- Have car wait at start for a couple of seconds.
