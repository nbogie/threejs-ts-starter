# Minimal example using Three.js (without typescript or the Parcel bunder)

Note, THIS example is fundamentally different to all the other examples in this repo.

It doesn't use node.js (e.g. parcel) to make a bundle. The code is written for immediate load by the browser (so only javascript is supported).

See any other branch (e.g. master) for a typescript example start.

### To start dev:

Right click on index.html and choose "open with live server"

### To deploy:

Deploy the contents of the src folder to a host such as netlify.
